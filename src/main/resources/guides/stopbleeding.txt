*Blood stopping guide:*

1. Stop Bleeding
    -Apply direct pressure on the cut or wound with a clean cloth, tissue, or piece of gauze until bleeding stops.
    -If blood soaks through the material, don’t remove it. Put more cloth or gauze on top of it and continue to apply pressure.
    -If the wound is on the arm or leg, raise limb above the heart, if possible, to help slow bleeding.
    -Wash your hands again after giving first aid and before cleaning and dressing the wound.
    -Do not apply a tourniquet unless the bleeding is severe and not stopped with direct pressure.

2. Clean Cut or Wound
    -Gently clean with soap and warm water. Try to rinse soap out of wound to prevent irritation.
    -Don’t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which can damage tissue.

*Artificial respiration guide:*

    1.Check the mouth for obstructions, lift the neck and tilt the head back.

    2.Pinch the nostrils and seal the mouth, and exhale directly into the victim's mouth.

    3.Release the nostrils and the seal around the mouth.

    4.Watch for the victim's chest to rise by itself.

    5.Feel for a pulse on the victim's neck.

    6.If the victim's chest does not start to rise on its own, repeat this process from number 1, until professional help arrives.

Rescue breathing should continue at a normal breathing pace of about 12 times per minute, until the victim is fully able to breath on his or her own. Even if the victim appears able to breath on their own, be sure to keep a close watch since relapses are common.

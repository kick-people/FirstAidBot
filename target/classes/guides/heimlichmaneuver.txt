*Heimlich Maneuver guide:*

1. Give Back Blows
@Give up to 5 blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.

2. If Person Is Still Choking, Do Thrusts

@If the person is not pregnant or too obese, do abdominal thrusts:
    -Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around the waist.
    -Place your clenched fist just above the personâ€™s navel. Grab your fist with your other hand.
    -Quickly pull inward and upward as if trying to lift the person up.
    -Perform a total of 5 abdominal thrusts.
    -If the blockage is still not dislodged, continue cycles of 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until the object is coughed up or the person starts to breathe or cough.
    -Take the object out of his mouth only if you can see it. Never do a finger sweep unless you can see the object in the person's mouth.

@If the person is obese or pregnant, do high abdominal thrusts:
    -Stand behind the person, wrap your arms them, and position your hands at the base of the breast bone.
    -Quickly pull inward and upward.
    -Repeat until the object is dislodged.

3. Give CPR, if Necessary

@If the obstruction comes out, but the person is not breathing or if the person becomes unconscious.
